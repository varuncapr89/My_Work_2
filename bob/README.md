  full

bob build Sub_Commands:
  cbase - "Triggers build on gc-rhel-base CodeBuild project and creates TF CICD pr"
  gbase - "Triggers build on whichever CodeBuild projects are using gov base image"
  mbase - "Updates smtp and s3 with latest medallia base image"

## Common Errors

- `package not found`
-- make sure the pip or pip3 used to install is python3.6 or newer

- `AccessDeniedException` when calling the ListProjects operation
-- make sure the user has `codebuild:ListProjects` action allowed in their user/role/etc. Or just add `AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess` policy directly to your IAM user permissions

## working example, for `gc-rhel-base` version 8.6-20:

```sh
{fede1}âžœ  bob git:(main) bob build all --base-image="8.6-20"
Building aws-encryption-provider
